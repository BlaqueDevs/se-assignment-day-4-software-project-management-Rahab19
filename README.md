## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile Methodology emphasizes on flexibility, collaboration and customer feedback.
Advantages
*Flexibility
*Faster Delivery
*Continuous Feedback
*Improved Quality
*Better Risk Management

Disadvantages
*Lack of Documentations.

*Easier to Manage.
*Defined Budget & Timeline.

Disadvantages
*Inflexible.
*Late Testing.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is best suited for projects that:
*Have evolving or unclear requirements
*Require frequent customer feedback
*Need fast delivery and continuous updates
*Involve high uncertainty or risk

Waterfall is best suited for projects that:
*Have well-defined and fixed requirements
*Require extensive documentation
*Have strict regulations or compliance needs
*Are highly structured with minimal flexibility

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in a Software Project.

*Requirement Analysis & Documentation – Clearly define and document project requirements to prevent misunderstandings.
*Code Reviews & Peer Testing – Regularly review code to identify and fix issues early.
*Automated Testing – Use tools like Selenium or Jest for consistent and fast testing.
*Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Automate builds, testing, and deployment to detect defects early.
*Unit Testing & Integration Testing – Validate individual components and their interactions

Importance of Maintaining High Standards.

*Customer Satisfaction – Ensures a smooth user experience and builds trust.
*Cost Reduction – Fixing bugs early is cheaper than post-release fixes.
*Security & Compliance – Protects sensitive data and meets regulatory requirements.
*Brand Reputation – Prevents negative reviews and loss of market credibility.
*Product Longevity – Ensures software remains scalable and maintainable over time.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

How Defining Project Scope Contributes to Successful Project Planning
*Prevents Scope Creep – Clearly outlines deliverables to avoid unnecessary changes.
*Sets Clear Expectations – Ensures all stakeholders understand the project goals.
*Improves Resource Allocation – Helps in budgeting time, money, and manpower efficiently.
*Enhances Risk Management – Identifies potential challenges early.
*Facilitates Better Scheduling – Helps in creating a realistic timeline and milestones.

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of a project into smaller, manageable tasks.Why is WBS Useful?

*Improves Task Management – Clearly defines work scope and responsibilities.
*Enhances Cost & Time Estimation – Helps in budgeting and scheduling.
*Increases Accountability – Assigns specific tasks to team members.
*Simplifies Progress Tracking – Makes it easier to monitor project completion.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?

Benefits of Developing a Detailed Project Schedule
*Improves Time Management - Ensures tasks are completed on time, preventing delays.
*Enhances Resource Allocation – Helps assign team members, tools, and budget efficiently.
*Increases Accountability – Defines clear roles and responsibilities for each task.
*Helps Identify Dependencies – Shows which tasks rely on others to be completed first.
*Facilitates Risk Management – Detects potential bottlenecks early for proactive solutions.

Benefits of Using Gantt Charts:
*Clear Task Visualization – Shows start and end dates of each task.
*Dependency Management – Highlights tasks that must be completed before others start.
*Progress Tracking – Allows real-time monitoring of completed and pending tasks.
*Resource Planning – Helps distribute workloads effectively across the team.
*Flexible Adjustments – Enables quick updates if deadlines shift.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
